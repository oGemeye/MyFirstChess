todo list

1. make backend classes for chess in python
2. add a front end
3. do it with as much functional programming as possible (with loop for input)
4. add a UI for the functional version

Current goal: backend complete
    -   add a nicer log, should include what piece moved, where it went, if it ate a piece
    -   add advanced moves like en pessante (how spell this shit), castling, pawn to queen swap
    -   remove messy global variables from pieceController.py
    -   refactor the coordinate system - it's really confusing right now
    -   stop pieces moving over other moves
